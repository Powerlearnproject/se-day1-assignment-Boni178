#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the process of testing,designing and building and maintaining diffrent software and diffrent applicaions such as websies, games and mobile apps.
It is important because software is very easy to scale up to meet business needs when businesses grow and expand. It is faster and more effient than human beings when it comees to implementin solutions.It offers security and protects sensitive data from hackers and cyber criminals.Its innovative and can turn ideas into real usable products.Software products meet high quality standards and must be reliable.It can also automate tasks without having to worry about human error.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Structured Programming (1960s-1970s) -code used to be messy and hard to follow until in the 60s and 70s they came up with rules that made it easier to write and understand.
Object-Oriented Programming (1980s-1990s)-in the 80s developers started using objects when they were creating software this made software easier to build, manage, and reuse, especially for large, complex systems.
Agile Methodology (2000s-Present)-Agile changed how software was developed by focusing on flexibility and teamwork and this made it easier to make software that worked faster and it made it easier to respond to changes quickly, and work better with their customers.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Planning - it is when you decide what the software should do and how to make it.
Design-it is when you plan on how the software will look and how it will work.
Development- it is when you build the software by writing code.
Testing-it is when you check for any mistakes or bugs in your code or application  and then fix them.
Deployment- it is the final part when you release the software to the people and for them to use it.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall Methodology-It follows a linear and sequential process. You move from one phase to the next (e.g., planning → design → development → testing → deployment) without going back.It is best for projects where requirements are clear from the start and unlikely to change.
Example-
A company building a simple accounting system where the requirements are fixed and won't change much.

Agile Methodology-It’s flexible and iterative. The project is divided into small chunks, and developers work in cycles (called sprints) to build parts of the software, test, and improve it. After each sprint, feedback is gathered, and changes are made.It is best for projects where requirements might change over time and you need to respond quickly.
Example-
A new mobile app where the team may need to change features or design based on user feedback and market changes.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer-Is responsible for bulding the software by writing the code for it.
Quality Assurance Engineer-Is responsible for making sure that the software works properly by testing it and by the finding bugs in it.
Project Manager- Is responsible for managing the project, making sure it’s completed on time and within budget, and for coordinating between the diffrent team members.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)-An IDE is a software application that gives developers the tools they needs to write, test, and debug code all in one place. It puts everything together to make coding faster and easier. Its important because it simplifies coding, makes debugging easier and its time saving. Examples of IDEs are Visual Studio Code,IntelliJ IDEA and Eclipse.
Version Control Systems (VCS)-A VCS is a tool that helps developers to track and to manage changes to their code over time. It also helps developers to save their different versions of the code, making it easier for them to go back to the previous versions and to be able to collaborate with others, and to avoid losing any work. Its important because allows for collaboration , It can track changes and you can have backups incase something went wrong.Examples of VCS are Git,Subversion (SVN) and Mercurial.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Bugs in code they can overcome this challenge by using debugging tools in IDEs to quickly find and fix bugs early.
Time management and deadlines which they can overcome by using time management tools like calendars and to-do lists to break big tasks into smallerand more manageable pieces as well as to stay organized.
Dealing with changing technologies which they can overcome by ensure that they learn core principles of programming because those remain consistent even when the diffrent tools change.
Collaborating with teams they can overcome this challenge by using VCSs like Git to track changes and avoid conflicts between developers and by having regular team meetings to discuss progress, challenges, and to share constructive feedback when it is necessary.
Stress and Burnout they can overcome this challenge by taking regular breaks and avoid working continuously and by settings realistic goals for yourself to avoiding doing too much.You should also communicate with your manager if you’re feeling overwhelmed and ask for a break if necessary.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing is testing small parts of the software, like individual functions or features, to make sure that it works correctly. It is important because it helps to find mistakes early before they become even bigger problems.
Integration Testing is testing how the different parts of the software work together.It is important because it helps us to make sure that all the diffrent parts work well together.
System Testing is testing the entire software system to make sure everything works as it is supposed to.It is important because it makes sure that the whole software works properly from the start to the finish.
Acceptance Testing is testing the software to see if it meets the needs of the customer or the user. It is important because it ensures the software does what the user wants before it's released.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

 Prompt engineering is asking AI questions in the right way in order for the AI to give you the most useful, clear, and accurate answers.It is important to interact with AI mddels because it helps with giving you better responses and it helps you with efficiency because prompts save you a lot of  time and it helps with customization if you can train the AI to give you answers in a specific style or format for example telling it to be casual, or professional.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague prompt- Tell me about about cats. -this will cause AI to give vague and general responses.
Clear prompt-What is the meaning of the cats depicted in Ancient Egyptian Artwork.-this will focus the AI on the topic of cats in Ancient Egyptian  artwork only instead of telling me general information about cats.
